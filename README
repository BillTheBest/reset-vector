************
* Overview

This is the reset vector code for the Intel Single-chip Cloud Computer (SCC).
It initializes processor registers for operating system bootstrap, then jumps
directly into the real-mode portion of the kernel.

The reset vector is specific to our SCC-specific Linux kernel, as it sets the
corresponding sub-architecture identifier in the bootloader parameter block.
